# My Research Problem
Take research questions, turn them into a project based around primary sources. 

I this chapter I want to learn how to avoid the risk of continually out-smarting myself. This is a recurring problem that I have, it is a good thing that I got a hold of this book. 

It is not identifying topics of interest that will be my problem but turning them into a specific set of questions. This will require that I develop a new modified personality. I need to be motivated by the unknown, not hide from it. I need to be both confidence and vulnerable, I personally believe these to be the same thing. 

### A Topic is not a question! 

The topic is matheuristics I think. I should not get arrogant about it.
