There has been excellent points in the book so far.

Imagined authorities guiding me. Not listening to what I believe to be correct. 

Write everything down, and NOW. 

## Three crucical points:
* Letting myself be vulnerable. In mail, coworkers, professors (especially Niels)
* Listening to what I believe to be right especially when it comes to coding. This is my main struggle when working that I doubt my inner voice. 
* Write everything down. Important for many things. Dendron is the best tool that I know of.
