There has been excellent points in the book so far.

Imagined authorities guiding me. Not listening to what I believe to be correct. 

Write everything down, and NOW. 

## Three crucical points:
* Letting myself be vulnerable. In mail, coworkers, professors (especially Niels)
* Listening to what I believe to be right especially when it comes to coding. This is my main struggle when working that I doubt my inner voice. 
* Write everything down. Important for many things. Dendron is the best tool that I know of.

## Sound Board
* Talking with someone I trust. About my problems and ideas.


Research is not to fallback, but leap out, discover something original

# Try This Now 
* Writing, even small things, personal things and of course on research topics is all part of the process of during research. 

* By continually writing I will get an evolving record of my ideas and develop my self-evidence. 

* By writing I continually externalize my research thoughts which both improves memory retention and get feedback from research community. I really need to be confident all the time. I will not do that I have anxity at work even once or less per week. It is simply too destrutive for my research and relationship that I need and need to develop. I cannot go hiding. It will not do. 

* I can build my project step by step by continually writing about ideas testing them. Refining them. 

* Make writing a habit. I wanted to do this for a long time anyway. 


## Common mistake:
Writing for someone else than myself. I should do what I believe is rigth. I should not impress anyone. I should only rationalize my thought to myself, not to please others. 


# What I want to research
I want to use operations research to improve the world. To do this I need to research something that is novel, something that I believe in, that I am willing to put a lot of work into. I believe that matheuristics is the way forward. I believe that integrating a mathematical model together with a heuristic can in many cases be the best way of solving a problem since it is fast and flexible. I believe that this approach can be used to generate key business insigths for basically every sector. I believe that to succeed I will have to become a master programmer, I believe that Julia is the best choice and becomming proficient in this will help me a great deal. I believe that integrating these tools with the web with corrosponding UI will let everyone approach, apply and uses the things that I can develop. I believe that doing this well will help me develop skill and an attitude what I will keep for the rest of my life. I think I will become diciplined by it, realize that research is a life style, that demands that I develop a flexible mind, a confident character and most importantly vulnerable emotional mindset. This is not just about doing research for DTU and Total, it is about becoming a person. Meditate if you forget. This is my road for becoming that the book calls a self centered researcher.
