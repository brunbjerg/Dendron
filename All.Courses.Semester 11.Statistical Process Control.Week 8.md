Cusum chart.

Shewhart chart does not take trends in to account.

Additional rules : 4 of 5 points above one standard limit.

Cusum chart takes all previous observations into account.

Accumulating 

comparing to the expectation. 

Assuming constant process, but could also be a function if process changes over time. 

Cusum goes up for a bad process.
 
Good process may signal if using k out of n above mean level.

Cusum will not go up. We do not want to react on small shifts. Could be expensive.

Indentify \mu_1 value

Cusum will keep getting more negative when allowing for a shift. This will make it hard to detect a purtubation if it happens after a long period of the process being in-control. 

This can be solved by only taking positive points into account. 

Cusum is good at detecting small changes that x-bar chart will not be good at detecting. This is nice and satisfying. 

You can create two values so that you take both upper and lower shifts into account. 

A new mean could occur if process is adjusted. There is a formula for calculating this new mean. 

Rational subgroups? 

Cusum may not be optimal for large shifts since it relies on cumulative changes.

If you start from a out of control situation i.e. bad process, you can start from a different point. 

Cusum for process variability. First standidize the variabilities.
