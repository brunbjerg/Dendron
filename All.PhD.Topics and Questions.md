Here I will focus on describing my topic and refining my thoughts so that I will be able to generate good questions to for my PhD.


Matheurics is a worthwhile subject, I believe that it has got a bright future. Is it the topic I want? That is hard to say. Being professor in that could be nice, but I have to let go of fear and comparisons with other people.
