## Here I will write about all my notes regarding my PhD.
It is crucial that I note down thoughts and ideas that I have about my PhD. So that I do not repeat the same thought patterns and so that I develop my topic into good questions that I care about. This will require that I persistently search for information, that I am not affraid of being vulnerable (this applies to most aspects of my life). I also need to be confident during my PhD I cannot let other people decide for me that will make me unmotivated for my job and extingush my spirit. I will write about what I want, no matter what other people believe. I know best, if I do not believe in my self this PhD will become an impossible task. I have to develop the vulnerability to be part of the team and speak openly about my ideas to them. Talk with them about everything, do not believe that they are superior to me or that I have to prove myself to be accepted. 

The reason that being on the job is so tough sometimes is because that I am affraid of being myself. This needs to stop! Do not a affraid to fail. This and this alone is what is holding me back in everything that I do. It is not that I will not fail if I am not affraid, but that it is completely okay to fail. Failing is good, it will save me so much time. I do not even want to be smart, I feel bad when I dominate people by being smarter than them anyway. Be vulnerable, if you do not posses the skills for a PhD, fine, that is okay. The real problem is you being sad about going to work or school, because you are affraid. Never be that. Use the fear as a cue that you should meditate. If you stress, use the calender, do not worry about it in the present. That is the key! Not in the present, never... It makes me so unproductive that I might as well not work at all.
